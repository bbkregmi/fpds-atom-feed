This project contains a small script to pull public data from fpds and generate a sql query to insert that data into a 
psql table.

## Start
`npm install`
`npm run start`

The script takes about 1 hour to complete, and the generated sql will be placed in `test.sql` file.
Plese modify `parseXml.js` file for changes to sql statement generated if you want different tables, columns, or values.

The total number of pages to query is a variable set in `app.js` file with variable name `maxPages`. If you want to test
a small number of pages initially, modify the `maxPages` variable for how many total pages you'd like to fetch.

By default, the script makes queries in batches of 40,000 requests at a time, waits for 60 seconds, and fires next batch.
Feel free to modify the number of batches as you see fit.

## Inserting to database
The file generated by this script is fairly large. It is recommended you execute the sql statement through the command line.
Recommended way to insert into database through the sql file:
 - login to your postgres database - `psql -h <host> -p <port> -U <username> -W <password> <database>`
 - Execute sql file - `\i path/to/test.sql`

This should execute the insert statement generated by the script.
